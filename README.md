# CS498_LHW2_Codes
Codes related to Q1, Q2, and Q3. Related to simrank++ and recommender systems 

LHW2_Q1.ipynb is about using simrank++ original paper to get similarity rankings of similar users, and ads together.

LHW2_Q2_and_Q3.ipynb involves two experiements. One of which is using cosine similarity in Item Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering to see how well the MSE is with or without bias. Another one is about matrix factorization with PyTorch's gradient decent algorithm to better understand how different settings of parameters effect the MSE.
